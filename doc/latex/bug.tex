\-Class \hyperlink{classIPQ_1_1IpqSocket}{\-I\-P\-Q\-:\-:\-Ipq\-Socket} ]\-Connect() does not detect if other another program is using libipq. \-Instead, if another program is connected, recv\-Packet() will throw an exception. \-This is due to a limitation in libipq. 

\-Due to a bug in \-Netfilter, changing the source \-I\-P address of a packet to a non-\/local address and then setting a verdict of \-N\-F\-\_\-\-A\-C\-C\-E\-P\-T will cause it to be dropped. \-This has been observed when the packet was queued from the \-O\-U\-T\-P\-U\-T chain of the mangle table. \-A work-\/around is to set a verdict of \-N\-F\-\_\-\-S\-T\-O\-P instead of \-N\-F\-\_\-\-A\-C\-C\-E\-P\-T, but be aware that this results in the packet being treated differently by iptables. \-Kernels prior to 2.\-6.\-12 do not have \-N\-F\-\_\-\-S\-T\-O\-P; defining \-N\-O\-\_\-\-N\-F\-\_\-\-S\-T\-O\-P enables another work-\/around\-: all packets are immediately dropped, and packets that are to be accepted are re-\/injected through raw sockets. \-In this case, care must be taken to ensure that infinite queueing loops do not occur. \-Also, this work-\/around only works for \-I\-P packets.

\-Class \hyperlink{classLibWheel_1_1WaitList}{\-Lib\-Wheel\-:\-:\-Wait\-List} ]\-The timer interrupt handler (\-Wait\-List\-::\-Wait\-G\-C) assumes that the list is sorted in chronological order. \-However, since list iterators are provided, this is not necessarily true. \-Consequently, objects that are out of chronological order will not be removed until after all objects before them in list order have timed out and been removed.

\-Class \hyperlink{classNERD_1_1ConnectionServer}{\-N\-E\-R\-D\-:\-:\-Connection\-Server} ]\-As described above, servers that have not responded within 10 seconds are assumed to be malfunctioning and are dropped. \-However, if the server is in fact still running, it will exit when it receives the \-S\-I\-G\-I\-N\-T or at some later time. \-This will result in a warning message indicating that \-S\-I\-G\-C\-H\-L\-D was received from a process for which no record exists. \-This could probably be fixed, but an extra log message is not currently considered to be a problem worthy of the effort required to fix it.
